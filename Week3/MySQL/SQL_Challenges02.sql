-- SETUP:
-- Create a database server (docker)
-- $ docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres 
--In our case it is MySQL
-- Connect to the server (Azure Data Studio / Database extension)
-- Test your connection with a simple query (like a select)
-- Execute the Chinook database (from the Chinook_pg.sql file to create Chinook resources in your server)

-- BASIC CHALLENGES
-- List all customers (full name, customer id, and country) who are not in the USA
SELECT customerName, customerNumber, country FROM customers WHERE country != 'USA';

-- List all customers from Brazil
SELECT customerName FROM customers WHERE country = 'Brazil';


-- List all sales agents
-- SELECT * FROM employee WHERE title LIKE '%Agent%;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE `jobTitle` LIKE '%Sale%';

-- Retrieve a list of all countries in billing addresses on invoices
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM `Invoice`


-- Retrieve how many invoices there were in 2009, and what was the sales total for that year?
SELECT * FROM `Invoice`;
SELECT Count(invoiceID) AS totalInvoice, SUM(Total) AS totalSales from `Invoice` WHERE `InvoiceDate` LIKE '2021_%' ;

-- (challenge: find the invoice count sales total for every year using one query)
SELECT YEAR(InvoiceDate) AS Year, COUNT(InvoiceID) AS totalInvoices, SUM(Total) AS totalSales FROM `Invoice` 
GROUP BY YEAR 
ORDER BY YEAR DESC

-- how many line items were there for invoice #37
SELECT * FROM `InvoiceLine`;


-- how many invoices per country? BillingCountry  # of invoices -
SELECT COUNT(invoiceID) AS invoicePerCountry, BillingCountry FROM `Invoice` 
GROUP BY `BillingCountry` 
ORDER BY `BillingCountry`;

-- Retrieve the total sales per country, ordered by the highest total sales first.
SELECT SUM(Total) AS totalPerCountry, BillingCountry FROM `Invoice` 
GROUP BY `BillingCountry`
ORDER BY totalPerCountry DESC;

-- ADVANCED CHALLENGES
-- solve these with a mixture of joins, subqueries, CTE, and set operators.
-- solve at least one of them in two different ways, and see if the execution
-- plan for them is the same, or different.

-- 1. which artists did not make any albums at all?


-- 2. which artists did not record any tracks of the Latin genre?
