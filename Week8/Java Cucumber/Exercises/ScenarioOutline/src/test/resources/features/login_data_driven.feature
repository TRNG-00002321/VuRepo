Feature: Data-Driven Login Testing
  As a QA engineer
  I want to test login with multiple credentials
  So that I can verify the authentication system works for all users

  Background:
    Given the user is on the login page

  @positive
  Scenario Outline: Successful login with valid credentials
    When the user enters username "<username>"
    And the user enters password "<password>"
    And the user clicks the login button
    Then the login should be "<result>"
    And the user should see message "<message>"

    # TODO: Create Examples table with at least 3 valid users
    Examples: Valid Users
      | username | password             | result  | message                          |
      | tomsmith | SuperSecretPassword! | success | You logged into a secure area!   |
      | tomsmith | SuperSecretPassword! | success | You logged into a secure area!   |
      | tomsmith | SuperSecretPassword! | success | You logged into a secure area!   |

  @negative
